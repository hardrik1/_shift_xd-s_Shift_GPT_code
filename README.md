**Why It’s Dope 🌟**
Shift_GPT runs on OpenRouter AI with a rock-solid fetch-based API, complete with retry logic and error handling that’s tougher than a sci-fi spaceship. 🛡️ The interface? Pure Tron vibes—glowing gradients, floating tool cards, and a grid background that screams futuristic cool. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and a sprinkle of Babel, it’s fast, responsive, and looks 🔥 on any screen.
Get Started 🚀

**Clone this repo and open index.html.**
Add your OpenRouter API key (keep it hush-hush! 🤫) in the callOpenRouterAPI function where it says <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>. Pro tip: Use a .env file and .gitignore to keep it secure!
Run it locally or deploy it to see the magic. Whether you’re coding, writing, or just vibing, Shift_GPT’s got your back.
